# Course 7 Lab

This repository contains the code and analysis for **Course 8 Lab** from the Flatiron Program.

## Overview

This project focuses on applying machine learning models, specifically regression and classification techniques, to predict loan approval outcomes and assess loan risk.

## Steps Involved

1. Data preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data.
2. Model building: Implementing Random Forest models for regression and classification.
3. Hyperparameter tuning: Optimizing the models using RandomizedSearchCV.
4. Model evaluation: Evaluating the models using metrics like RÂ², accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
